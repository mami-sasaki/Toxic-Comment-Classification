    "As a NLP Engineer, I've always been interested in working on maulicious comments such as cyberbullying, abuse, hate speech, violent threats to create safe and healthy cyperspace and to protect kids from tragic outcomes.  \n",

    "In this work, I built a binary classifcation model which is capable of detecting toxic comments. \n",
    "The data are downloaded from toxic comment classificaiton challenge dataset from Kaggle which contains omments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits. The training data contains 159571 and test contains 153164 comments and they are classified as either toxic (class = 1) or non toxic (class = 0).\n",

    "I used this training dataset to train a model that can take in new comments in test dataset and predict whether they are toxic or not.\n",
    "The data also include different types of toxicity which are toxic, severe toxic, threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. I would like to further investigate and build multiclassificaiton model as a next step in the near future. "
